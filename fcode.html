        <h1>Backtracking</h1>    

<p> Copyright &#169;2002 by David</p>
<p>The usual scenario is that you are <i>faced with a number of options</i> aand you must choose one<br>
       After you make a <i>choice</i> youe will get a set of option just what options you get depends on what choices<br>
       you made.
</p>

<p>You can <i>backtrack</i> to continue to search for a good leaf<br> and try out the next option in that
set of options</p>
<br>

<div class="world">
    <pre>
        int main() {
            printf("Hello World");
        }
    </pre>
</div>
<center><img src="download.png" alt="Ball" style="background-color: darkorange; border-radius: 50%; border-style: dashed;" ></center>

<ul class="list">
    <li>Starting at Root ,your options are A and B</li>
    <li>C is bad, go back yo A</li>
    <li>Starting at Root ,your options are A and B</li>
    <li>D is bad, go back to A</li>
    <li>At Root  you have already tried A</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>

<p>In this example we drew a picture of a tree. The tree is an abstract model of the possible sequences of choices we could make. There is also a data structure called a tree, <br>
    but usually we don't have a data structure to tell us what choices we have. (If we do have an actual tree data structure, backtracking on it is called depth-first tree searching.)
</p>

<h3>The Backtracking Alorithm.</h3>
<p>Here is the algorithm (in pseudocode) for doing backtracking from a given node n:
</p>

<h3><pre>
    boolean solve(Node n) {
        if n is a leaf node {
            if the leaf is a goal node, return true
            else return false
        } else {
            for each child c of n {
                if solve(c) succeeds, return true
            }
            return false
        }
</pre>
</h3>

<p>How does this work?</p>
<ul>
    <li>If any child of n is solvable </li>
    <li>If no child is solvable </li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>

<h3>Keep Backtracking Simple</h3>
<p>To keep the program clean, therefore, tests like this should be buried in methods. In a <font size="+2">Chess</font> game, for example, you could test whether a node is a leaf by writing a gameOver method (or you could even call it <b>isLeaf</b>).<br>
     This method would encapsulate all the ugly details of figuring out whether any possible moves remain.
</p>

<p>The most straightforward way to keep track of which children of the node have been tried is as follows: Upon initial entry to the node (that is, when you first get there from above), make a list of all its children. As you try each child, take it off the list. When the list is empty, <br>
    there are no remaining untried children, and you can return <b>"failure."</b> <br> This is a simple approach, but it may require quite a lot of additional work.</p>
</p>

<h4>And finally, here's the recursive backtracking routine to "solve" the binary tree by finding a goal node.</h4>

<p>
<pre>
       static boolean solvable(BinaryTree Mode){
       /*1*/ if (node == null) return false;
       /*2*/ if (node == null) return false;
       /*3*/ if (solvable(node.leftChild)) return true;
       }
</pre>   
</p>
<p>
    <pre>
    <font size="+1">boolean mapISOK()></font>
           Used by method one to check whether the entire map is colored correctly.
    </pre>
</p>


<p>
    <pre>
    <font size="+1">boolean okToColor(int row, int column, int color)</font>
           Used by method 2 to check, at every node, whether there is an adjacent node already colored with the given color.
    </pre>
</p>
<p>Those appear pretty similar, and you might think they are equally good. However, the timing information suggests otherwise:</p>


    <center><table class="taab1">

    <center>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>
                              
        </td>
        <td>
            2 by 3 map
        </td>
        <td>
            3 by 3 map
        </td>
        <td>
            3 by 4 map
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            Method 1:
        </td>
         <td>
             60ms
         </td>
         <td>
             940mx
         </td>
         <td>
             1733ms
         </td>    
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

</center>

<p>The zeros in the above table indicate times too short to measure (less than 1 millisecond). Why this huge difference? Either of these methods could have exponential growth.<br> Eliminating a node automatically eliminates all of its descendents, and this will often prevent exponential growth. Conversely, by waiting to check until a leaf node is reached, exponential growth is practically guaranteed.<br> <i>If there is any way to eliminate children (reduce the set of choices), do so!</i>
    </p>

<p>
    we modify solvable as:
</p>

<p>
    <font size="+2">
        <pre>
        static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node) {
            enter(node);
            <b>if (node == null) return no(node);</b>
            if (node.isGoalNode) return yes(node);
            if (solvable(node.leftChild)) return yes(node);
            if (solvable(node.rightChild)) return yes(node);
            return no(node);
        }
        </pre>
    </font>
</p>

<p>
    And we get these result:
</p>

<p>
    <pre>
       <font size="+2">
       <b>    Entering solvable(Root)
           |  Entering solvable(A)

           |  |  |  solvable(null) returns false

        <b>Trick #4: Create an Exception</b>. If an <strong> Exception</strong> is thrown, you can get information about just where it happened by sending it the message printStackTrace(PrintStream).<br>
         Since an <font size="+1"><b>Exception is an object</b></font>like any other, you can create and throw your own Exceptions.

         Example:"Cindy's Puzzle"
     </h3>

     <p>
        I call the following puzzle "Cindy's puzzle" for historical reasons. <br>You have some number n of black marbles and the same number of white marbles, and you have a playing board which consists simply of a line of 2n+1 spaces to put the marbles in. Start with the black marbles all at one end (say, the left), the white marbles all at the other end, and a free space in between.
